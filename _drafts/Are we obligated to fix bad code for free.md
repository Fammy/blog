## The Premise

A few weeks ago I misread something online as "you shouldn't charge to fix bugs". What a ludicrous statement, I thought. As that notion lingered in my head, I started to consider it. Is it okay to charge our clients to fix the bugs and technical debt that we created? Is that ethical? How do other professions deal with this?

## Personal History

I spent the first ten years of my career as a software consultant. I rarely wrote a line of code that I or my company owned. All the code I authored was a [work-for-hire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_for_hire). It belonged to the client. Like any software project<sup>[^1]</sup>, those systems had bugs. Even those written ten years ago still do. It's the nature of the business.

## Other Professions

Let's consider various other professions. On one end of the spectrum, we have professions like mechanics or carpenters. If you hired someone from one of those professions and they put your engine in wrong or installed your cabinet doors upside down, there's a reasonable expectation that they'll have to fix that "bug".

And you, as a customer, won't have to pay for the fix.

On another end of the spectrum, you have lawyers and doctors. Each does their best to ensure a positive outcome, but a "bug" on their part doesn't go fixed for free (except in extreme examples such as malpractice).

If your doctor diagnoses your flu as a stomach bug (pun intended), you as the customer still pay for a return visit. If your legal counsel loses your court case, you still have to pay for the appeal.

## Status Quo

So where do software bugs fit in? Should we (or our company) guarantee the code we write? Only against severe defects?

## New Reality

[^1]: I once had a manager who claimed that his previous project was bug free. He made that the standard that my team should live up to.
