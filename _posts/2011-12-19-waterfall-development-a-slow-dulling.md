I'm sure this comparison has been made before, but repeated use of the [waterfall development model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model) has a slow, dulling effect on software teams (and the systems they ultimately create). Stones at the bottom of a waterfall are far more likely to be rounded after years of wear by the falling water. Likewise, a developer, business analyst, QA tester, project manager, and (possibly) designer start to wear down after the same rigid process, repeated over and over.
