I was on a call with a client the other day and realized I wasn't getting good answers. Instinctively, I wanted to blame the person answering the question. I'd never blame a client (coworkers are fair game ;) ), so I took a step back and thought about the situation. It was instantly obvious that I wasn't asking a good question. If you want a good answer, you should ask a good question.
