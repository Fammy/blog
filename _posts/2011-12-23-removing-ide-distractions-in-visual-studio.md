I'm not sure where I first read about "distraction free Visual Studio", but it's a thing, and I quite enjoy it. This [article](http://www.thebooleanfrog.com/post/2011/11/23/Distraction-Free-Coding-in-Visual-Studio.aspx) explains how to take to the extreme. At a minimum, I suggest turning off all your various toolbars. How often do you really use them?
